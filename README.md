# mePed Robot Projects

## Intro
This is a repository of projects written for the [mePed v2](https://www.meped.io/mepedv2) Arduino-based robot. Based on the original code provided by the robot's creator, we intend to see what this great little robot can do!

## How to Use This Code
1. Buy a mePed robot [from their store](https://www.spiercetech.com/shop/12-robot-kits)
2. Install the free [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
3. Download and open one of the project files in the IDE
4. Have fun!

## Projects
1. Basic robot movement in response to IR remote commands

## Troubleshooting
- For Macs, you may need to install a separate USB-driver to allow your computer to communicate with the Arduino used by the robot. Download the [CH-340 Driver](http://www.elegoo.com/tutorial/CH340%20Driver.zip)
